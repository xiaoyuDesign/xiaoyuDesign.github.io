So They can easily see the trend of mood and reflect on what affected their emotion.</div></div></div></div></div><div class=aims><div class=container><div class="normal dark-text">Some background</div><div class="normal dark-text">Ginger.io's consumer app uses patient’s phone as a sensor to track data like location, or how many phone calls they have made each day, or like screen unlocking at 3 am in the morning, and employ a number of algorithms to alert health caregivers of changes that may indicate symptoms or crises.<br>To make the magic really happen, we need to gather as much data as possible from our consumer app to finish our behavior data models. And to gather more data, we need to make an app people would like to keep in their phone everyday and to answer some surveys about their health. So we need to provide value for users to use the app constantly before we can really help them with triaging their mental illness.<br></div><div class="sub-title highlight-text">Step 0</div><div class="bold dark-text">Prioritize</div><div class="normal dark-text">Before I joined, our UX team already conducted some user research, figured out the primary design goal, the visual style and a few key functionalities. And we had just released our app (Version 3.0) with limited functionalities.</div><img src=/images/mood/plan-reality.png alt="" style="margin: 37px 0; max-width: 500px"><div class="normal dark-text">Based on our user's feedback, our design team sat together to talk about what is going to happen next in our app. And we decided that our highest priority for next release was to show users their data by providing them daily and weekly overview cards (of data that we are tracking) and visualize the data to help them identify their ups and downs.</div></div></div><div class=discussion><div class=container><div class="sub-title highlight-text">Step 1</div><div class="bold dark-text">Empathize</div><div class="normal dark-text">When I joined, our team had already conducted several interviews with our target users. Our budget and time did not allow me to do more user interviews specifically for the features I am designing, so I started from reading the documentations of our User Interview Notes, Persona, User Stories and etc., collecting things that I think was related to the features that I am designing.</div><div class="normal dark-text">From my research, I knew that patients living with a chronic condition worry about their health everyday. They want to see how their actions are affecting their overall health. They may already have some assumptions and want a way to confirm their feelings.</div><img src=/images/mood/research.png alt="" style="margin: 37px 0; max-width: 557px"><div class="sub-title highlight-text">Step 2</div><div class="bold dark-text">Define</div><div class="normal dark-text">I set my design goal as to provide our users an intuitive way of seeing how their general well being (or mood, pain, sleep, etc.) was during the past few days to identify the good or bad periods and also see what was going on at that time.</div><br><br><div class="sub-title highlight-text">Step 3</div><div class="bold dark-text">Ideate</div><div class="normal dark-text">I started from listing all the possible functionalities and then sketched to visualize my ideas.</div><img src=/images/mood/sketch.png alt="" style="margin: 37px 0; width: 100%"> <img src=/images/mood/explore.png alt="" style="margin: 37px 0; max-width: 500px"><div class="normal dark-text">And this is the direction i picked. I liked it because:<br><br>1. It's not distracting users from other contents in the activity feed<br>2. Bad score doesn’t look too "scary" that may make people feel bad<br>3. It's Clean<br>4. It's easy for users to identify "Ups and downs"</div><img src=/images/mood/direction.png alt="" style="margin: 37px 0; max-width: 500px"><div class="normal dark-text">For interaction, there was two main ideas but I got stucked on choosing between them. One was very simple, doesn't have much flexibility. The other one was more complex and powerful, allowing users to compare different factors and swith between daily trends to weekly or monthly trends.</div><img src=/images/mood/ideas.png alt="" style="margin: 37px 0; max-width: 500px"><br><br><div class="normal dark-text">My choice between these two designs was based on user need and technical feasibility. And I decided to keep it simple and make it work.<br>I went back to read our Personas, and then realized that most of our target users are not as tech savvy as I am, nor are they analysts. We shouldn't make them read complicated graph or interact with the graph like interacting with an app inside an app. But we can help them identify the ups and downs and find what happened on good days and what happened on bad days.<br>The other thing I couldn't ignore was that as a startup company, we don't have enough development resource to make everything happen at a once. Instead, we build and iterate. A complex analytics tool is "good to have", but right now we have to deliver something simple but useful.</div><br><br><br><div class="sub-title highlight-text">Step 4</div><div class="bold dark-text">Prototype</div><div class="normal dark-text">There was a lot of UI transitions(animations) in my design that I would like to prototype. Our design lead suggested me to use Quartz Composer and Origami. It took me a few days to learn Quartz Composer because the learning curve was very steep, but then I was able to quilkly make the prototype using it.<br>After adding more and more functionalities into my prototype, I found it’s very easy for things to get complex and out of control in Quartz Composer. So I focus on very specific interactions/animations that I want to prototype, and build compositions around them.<br></div><img src=/images/mood/ideas.png alt="" style="margin: 37px 0; max-width: 550px"><div class="bold dark-text">Deliverables</div><div class="normal dark-text">The final deliverables includes Quartz Composer Animation (can be viewed in Xcode) and Visual Design Specification and Assets.</div><img src=/images/mood/deliver.png alt="" style="margin: 37px 0; max-width: 500px"><div class="sub-title highlight-text">My reflection - Think big, start small, move fast</div><div class="bold dark-text">Think big</div><div class="normal dark-text">In this new app version, we are putting almost everything (the survey, the health tips, the daily overview card, the weekly summary, the history) into the activity feed. The idea we would like to convey is that “everything happens in your life is related to your health”.<br>During the time I was working on the design, I though about the big picture again and agin. I felt the idea is right. But there’s some limitations. There’s a gap between “Eveything happened in life” and “things we are tracking in app”. But I do believe with the development of technology, there are more and more data available, like iOS 8 HealthKit APIs, that can be used for optimizing our data model.</div><br><br><div class="bold dark-text">Start small</div><div class="normal dark-text">Rome wasn't built in a day. We had to prioritize the thing we need to design and move step by step. Keeping the Customer Desirability, Technical Feasibility and Business Viability in mind, we identified the initiatives that will lead to the ultimate version of the Ginger.io app that are doable, that gave us wins and successes to maintain the momentum so crucial to keep going.<br><br></div><div class="bold dark-text">Move fast</div><div class="normal dark-text">In school, most of my student projects had a relatively long timeline. Out in the field, I realized that UX professionals don’t always have the luxury of being able to follow the ideal design or research process due to time or budget constrains. There’s always lots of trade-offs and compromises, I had to adapt and till produce high-quality work.<br><br></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class="page-navigation mood"><a href=gingerio-relief.html class="left relief"><span class=indicator></span><div class=content-container><div class=title>previous project</div><div class=content>Relief<br>one step at a time</div></div></a><a href=nerdwallet.html class="right nerdwallet"><span href=nerdwallet.html class=indicator></span><div class=content-container><div class=title>next project</div><div class=content>Save more on<br>credit card interest</div></div></a></div><div class=copyright><div class=content>© 2017 Xiaoyu Ji</div></div></footer></div><script src="scripts/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="scripts/owl.carousel.min.js"></script><script src=scripts/main.min.js></script>
