We made tables containing all the cards’ information for easier comparison, and rank them by the value they can provide to an average user.</div><div class=normal>In most of the credit card categories, people end up choosing the first card on the list. But for balance transfer credit cards, there’s an unusual amount of heat around a product lower on the list. What’s unique about this product is it’s 0% balance transfer fee (while other cards require at least 3%).</div><div class=normal>Our hypothesis</div><div class=bold>The “power of free” and “hyperbolic discounting” may have affected user perception of their “best choice”.</div></div></div><div class=discussion><div class=container><div class="normal dark-text" style="border-bottom: dotted 1px #ce7834">While we could simply just move the 6th card to the top to make it easier for people to find, we wanted to understand what really go in to the decision making and gain visibility of their long term goal to make our tools trully helpful.<br><br>To understand that, let me first explain what balance transfer credit cards can do:<br><br></div><br><div class="light dark-text" style="border-bottom: dotted 1px #ce7834">A balance transfer card usually offers you a 0% interest rate for a period of time. If you have a high balance on a credit card, you can transfer the debt to a credit card with a lower rate to saving money on interest, and possibly pay down debt faster.<br><br></div><br><br><br><br><div class="sub-title highlight-text">Digging deeper</div><br><div class="normal dark-text">We talked to 8 users to understand their situation and motivations, and found out:</div><br><br><br><div class="sub-title highlight-text">Findings #1</div><br><div class="bold dark-text">People’s research is time sentive and goal oriented because they’re currently paying existing debt at a high interest rate.</div><br><br><div class="sub-title highlight-text">Findings #2</div><br><div class="bold dark-text">People want to save money, but they don't think they have enough time to figure out the absolute best option. </div><br><br><div class="sub-title highlight-text">Findings #3</div><br><div class="bold dark-text">Most users have a limit of how much they can put toward their debt</div><br><br><div class="normal dark-text">While transfering balance seems to be a good deal, there are also limitations and constrains people need to take into consideration:<br>1. All balance transfer credit cards require a good to excellent credit score to qualify<br>2. A balance transfer cannot be done between the same bank or card issuer<br>My design goal is not only to help people figure out how to save more money, but also to remind them about all the limitations and constrains.</div><br><br><div class="sub-title highlight-text">My design guideline</div><div class="bold dark-text">1. Be insightful: help people compare long term value instead of focusing on short term loss<br>2. Be personal: help people figure out their own pay-off plan based on their monthly budget<br>3. Keep it Low cost: validate idea quickly before heavily invest resource<br></div><br><br><div class="normal dark-text">In order to personalize the results, we need to collect user input. We had to figure out “what to ask“ “how to ask” and “when to ask”.

We wanted to design for everyone, but ended up design for no one since nobody in the interview told us they understand how we calculated the numbers and what the numbers even mean. In order to personalize, we can ask a couple questions to show user a result or we can ask more than 10 questions to provide a even more personalized results. My challenge was to minimize how much we ask but to maximize value we provide. My guidlines are:</div><br><br><div class="sub-title highlight-text">- 80% 20% principle<br>- Inclusion of the deal breakers<br></div><img src=/images/nerdwallet/3.png alt="" style="margin: 29px 0 70px"><div class="bold dark-text">How to show calculation?</div><div class="normal dark-text">In user testing, we also found out showing how we calculated the numbers goes a long way in building trust with the users.

We also talked to our users to get qualitative feedback. We were glad to see our new design is able to make them feel much more confident in their choice. Here’s what they said:<br><br>“…I trust that this gives me the clearest picture of which card is best for me and my situation.”<br><br>“Not only you know simply what my terms were, which was very black and white, but also what I could save. I thought that was very nice.”<br><br>“…that's actually really useful information...”</div><br><br><br><div class="bold dark-text">Next iteration</div><br><br><div class="normal dark-text">Modal was not the best experience for our users. Alough we allow people to skip the questions, it blocks users from immediately seeing results. In addition, changing the input is hard, you have to go through the questions again.<br><br>In my next iteraction, I redesigned the whole structure of the page, allowing people to view results without any input, but also to be able to customize when they want to. And seeing the numbers changing when they change their monthly payment is a very convinient way for them to optimize their monthly budget.</div><img src=/images/nerdwallet/7.png alt="" style="margin-top: 57px"></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=page-navigation><a href=mood.html class="left mood"><span class=indicator></span><div class=content-container><div class=title>previous project</div><div class=content>How did you feel<br>yesterday?</div></div></a><a href=gingerio-relief.html class="right relief"><span class=indicator></span><div class=content-container><div class=title>next project</div><div class=content>Relief<br>one step at a time</div></div></a></div><div class=copyright><div class=content>© 2017 Xiaoyu Ji</div></div></footer></div><script src="scripts/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="scripts/owl.carousel.min.js"></script><script src=scripts/main.min.js></script>
